As I follow along, frantically writing the code as the instructor, the next lecturemay have had the code structure slightly different. This made it difficult to determine where my code was broken because my lines of code were not matching up to the line numbers within the editor. This may be my fault as I skipped through the first two lectures quickly. Overall I found this course very helpful and I will suggest it to friends."
